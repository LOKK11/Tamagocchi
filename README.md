# Tamagotchi made by Ossi Myllym√§ki and Julius Haukipuro as a part of a University course "Computer systems".

This is an embedded systems project where we used Texas instrumets Sensortag to make a virtual pet that can react to movement and temperature changes by making noises and flashing lights. Doing these actions also updates the game state. The game runs on a separete platform with which the Tamagotchi communicates with UART (universal asyncronous receiver transmitter).
