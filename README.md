# Tamagotchi made by Ossi Myllym√§ki and Julius Haukipuro as a part of a University course "Computer systems".

This is an embedded systems project where we used Texas instrumets Sensortag to make a virtual pet that can react to movement and temperature changes by making noises and flashing lights.
